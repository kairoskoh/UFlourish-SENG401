# UFlourish-SENG401
This project is part of SENG401 Software Architecture at the University of Calgary.

## Set-up Guide

This project will be using Visual Studio Community 2019 as the IDE, with the in-built C# and ASP.NET framework.

The tutorial that this project used can be found [here](https://youtu.be/BfEjDD8mWYg).

This tutorial should get you up to speed on the project structure, how it works and how to work on it.

## Git Branching Strategy

Before working on your assigned use case, make sure to follow these steps below:

1. Create your own branch from Master and name it something meaningful like "UC1-Users-Auth-Chun".
2. Work on this new branch you have created.
3. Create a pull request to merge your new branch to "master".
4. Do not approve your own pull request. Make sure to review code as a team.
