## Set-up Guide

This project will be using Visual Studio Community 2019 as the IDE, with the in-built C# and ASP.NET framework.

The tutorial that this project used can be found [here](https://youtu.be/BfEjDD8mWYg).

This tutorial should get you up to speed on the project structure, how it works and how to work on it.

## Git Branching Strategy

Before working on your assigned use case, make sure to follow these steps below:

1. Create your own branch from Master and name it something meaningful like "UC1-Users-Auth-Chun".
2. Work on this new branch you have created.
3. Create a pull request to merge your new branch to "master".
4. Do not approve your own pull request. Make sure to review code as a team.


## How to make it run on your computer.
1. Make sure you clone this Git hub to your computer, have VS Studio working and updated to current version
2. Once the project is loaded in VS Studio, execute the command 'add-migration <migration_name>'
3. If the last command gets executed successfully execute the command 'update-database'
4. Once finished, run the program, website should be up and running.<br><br>
